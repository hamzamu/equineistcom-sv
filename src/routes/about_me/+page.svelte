<h1>About the Equineist.com</h1>

Welcome to **The Equineist** — a space where medicine, code, and horsemanship collide.

I’m a medical doctor by training, a software developer by habit, and an accidental horse owner who never saw the saddle coming. What began as a curious detour into riding has evolved into a deep, passionate connection with horses and the vibrant community that surrounds them. Along the way, I’ve witnessed beauty, wisdom, and some practices so dangerously misguided they needed to be spoken about — not with judgment, but with care.

At The Equineist, I write from three perspectives:  
As a **doctor**, I bring clinical insight to equine health, injury prevention, and the subtle signs of stress or illness in horses.  
As a **rider**, I share raw, honest observations — the joys, frustrations, and lessons learned on the trail and in the arena.  
As a **writer and technologist**, I document it all with clarity, curiosity, and a commitment to truth.

This blog is my record of what I’ve learned — the right way, the wrong way, and the way too many people don’t talk about. Because when it comes to horses, silence isn’t kindness — it’s risk.

And yes, I also write at **Medevel.com** — where I explore healthcare innovation, open-source technology, Linux systems, and the intersections between digital tools and human well-being.

So whether you’re a rider, a vet, a tech enthusiast, or someone just trying to understand how a doctor ended up writing about horseback riding — welcome.  
You’re exactly where you should be.
