You know, I’ve spent the last 15 years living in Turkey,  not just as a doctor, but as someone who’s deeply in love with horses. I’ve moved between farms more times than I can count, chasing better care for my horse, Kuzey, and trying to find a place where every horse felt truly seen. Along the way, I’ve been part of riding clubs, training centers, small stables, and even big equestrian events. And one thing kept hitting me: the way we manage horses is still so manual, so scattered.

While I was visiting some cattle farms,  yes, cows,  I was stunned by how advanced their systems were. They used digital record-keeping, automated feeding schedules, health tracking, even AI-powered monitoring for illness. Meanwhile, here we are, relying on notebooks, sticky notes, Excel spreadsheets that get lost in folders, or worse,  nothing at all. A vet visit? You might have to dig through old photos or ask your trainer if they remember when the last vaccination was. It’s not just inconvenient,  it’s risky.

That’s why, as a developer, a doctor, and most importantly,  a horse lover,  I decided to do something about it.

I started building tools not because I wanted to be “techy,” but because I saw a real need. I’ve spent years learning equine anatomy, behavior, farrier practices, and veterinary medicine,  not just academically, but from being out there in the barn, feeling the weight of responsibility when something goes wrong. When my horse had a flare-up during a tough season, I didn’t have a clear timeline of his past issues. I didn’t have a system. That moment stuck with me. So I built this tool,  the Horse Record & Report Generator,  not as a side project, but as a promise: no more losing track of what matters.

This tool is simple, but powerful. You fill in your horse’s name, age, breed, sex, owner,  and then start logging every event: vaccinations, farrier visits, training sessions, injuries, show results, even mood changes. You can add multiple horses, each with their own timeline. Then, when you need a report,  whether for a vet, a boarding facility, an insurance company, or just to share with a new trainer,  you click “Download Report” and boom. A clean, professional CSV file with everything in one place. No hassle. No passwords. No cloud storage. Nothing gets saved on any server. Your data lives only in your browser until you download it. If you close the tab, it’s gone,  unless you choose to keep it.

And yes, I’ve made it free. Because I believe every horse owner, no matter their budget, deserves access to tools that make life easier, safer, and more organized.

But this is just the beginning.

My dream is to build around 30 horse and equine-related tools,  not flashy apps, but practical, thoughtful solutions designed for real-life challenges. Tools for managing pasture rotations, predicting lameness based on gait patterns, tracking feeding schedules tailored to individual needs, even AI-assisted diagnostics for common issues. I’m already working on a few, and I plan to release them one by one, always open-source, always community-driven.

Why open-source? Because I believe knowledge should be shared. I’ve seen too many great ideas die in private silos. By making these tools open-source, anyone can contribute, improve, adapt them,  whether you’re a student, a vet, a trainer, or a fellow horse owner. Collaboration makes things better. And I want this ecosystem to grow organically, shaped by the people who use it.

I also write regularly about healthcare, open-source development, and building AI applications,  not just for humans, but for animals too. As a doctor, I’ve seen how AI can help detect early signs of disease, streamline coding, and support clinical decisions. Now, I’m applying those same principles to equine care. Imagine an AI assistant that learns from thousands of horse records,  not to replace vets, but to help owners spot subtle changes before they become emergencies. Or one that suggests personalized training plans based on your horse’s temperament, fitness level, and goals.

I’m not building this for profit. I’m doing it because I care. Because I’ve sat in the stall after a long day, watching my horse breathe, knowing he’s more than a pet,  he’s a partner. He’s taught me patience, resilience, emotional healing. My son Mo, who’s been around horses since he was three, has grown up with them too,  and I see how much they teach kids about empathy, responsibility, and trust.

So this isn’t just software. It’s a movement,  one horse, one farm, one record at a time.

I’ve lived through loneliness in a foreign country, through divorce, through hard choices. But my horse has always been there,  steady, silent, grounding. He’s helped me heal. And now, I want to give back,  not just to him, but to everyone who shares that bond.

If you’re a horse owner, a farm manager, a trainer, or even just someone who loves horses, I invite you to try this tool. Use it. Share it. Suggest improvements. Help me build something meaningful together.

Because the future of equine care shouldn’t be about keeping up with outdated systems. It should be about using smart, kind, accessible tools to protect and honor the incredible beings we call our partners.

And yes,  I’ll keep building. One line of code, one record, one horse at a time.

Welcome to the future of horse care.  
It’s quiet. It’s thoughtful.  
And it’s finally here.

### ✅ How This Tool Is Useful,  Real-Life Benefits

Here’s exactly how this tool helps different people in everyday situations:

#### 🐴 For Individual Horse Owners:
- **Never miss a vaccination or deworming**,  log it once, see it forever.
- **Track health trends**,  notice if your horse is acting differently over time (e.g., frequent minor lameness).
- **Prepare for vet visits**,  bring a full history, not just vague memories.
- **Share records easily**,  send a report to a new trainer, boarding stable, or veterinarian in seconds.
- **Keep a personal journal**,  document milestones like first jump, first show, or recovery from injury.

#### 🏡 For Horse Farms & Stables:
- **Standardize records across staff**,  no more confusion between trainers or managers.
- **Generate compliance reports**,  quickly pull data for inspections, insurance, or licensing.
- **Improve communication**,  share updates with owners without guesswork.
- **Onboard new staff faster**,  hand them a complete history instead of a stack of papers.
- **Reduce errors**,  no more misread handwriting or lost forms.

#### 🎯 For Riding Clubs & Training Centers:
- **Ensure safety**,  verify that all horses are up-to-date on vaccines before events.
- **Manage entries**,  compile a master list of participating horses with their histories.
- **Support young riders**,  let them learn to track progress, build confidence.
- **Handle disputes fairly**,  if there’s a question about a horse’s condition, you have proof.

#### 📊 For Vets & Trainers:
- **Get accurate background info**,  avoid asking owners to recall events from months ago.
- **Spot patterns early**,  e.g., recurring lameness after certain workouts.
- **Tailor treatment plans**,  base recommendations on real, documented history.
- **Save time**,  no need to re-enter basic data; just review what’s already logged.

#### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 For Families & Kids:
- **Teach responsibility**,  let children help log feedings, grooming, or rides.
- **Celebrate achievements**,  create a visual timeline of growth and milestones.
- **Build emotional connection**,  recording moments turns into shared stories.
- **Keep memories alive**,  even if the horse passes, the record stays.
