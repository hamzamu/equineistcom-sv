That promise you heard, “Just eight lessons, and you’ll be galloping like a pro!”, it’s not just misleading. It’s dangerous. And worse? It’s built on a lie that profits people while leaving riders broken, horses hurt, and dreams crushed. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. Farms where the “training” is nothing more than students standing awkwardly on horses that are lunged in tiny circles. No balance. No rhythm. No feel. Just force, ego, and a fake sense of progress. They teach you to stand, not to ride. Then, when you finally manage to stay on during a trot (which they call “cantering”), they say, “You’re ready! You can ride!”
That’s not riding. That’s a trap.

### How This “System” Works (And Why It’s Built on Greed)

Here’s the ugly truth behind the scenes:

- The student learns only two speeds: walk and trot.
- They’re never taught how to feel the horse’s movement or connect with its body.
- They’re given cheap, outdated tack, saddles so heavy they could double as weights, and told it’s “traditional.”
- Their confidence is inflated by fake wins, not real skill.
- Soon, they’re sold a horse, often one already damaged by bad hands.
- They pay monthly fees to keep their horse at that same farm.
- They fall. Hard. Fractures. Hospital visits. Broken trust.

Then comes the final act: they sell the horse and gear cheap, to the very people who hurt them.


It’s not education. It’s exploitation. A cycle of profit built on ignorance, fear, and the love people have for horses.

### The Real Cost: Not Just Money, But Humanity
Over 15 months, I counted nearly 38 accidents at one farm alone. Thirty-three were women. Seventeen ended up in hospitals with fractures. All because someone said, “Just stand. Don’t worry. You’ll be fine.”
But you’re not fine. And your horse isn’t either.

Horses aren’t machines. They’re sensitive, intelligent beings who feel every mistake you make. When you’re unbalanced, when you’re forcing, when you’re not listening, they know. And they suffer.

And so do you.

### So What Do You Do Instead? Here Are 10 Ways to Build Real Skill (and True Respect)

1. Start With Groundwork
Before you even think about mounting, learn to be with your horse. Grooming. Lunging. Walking. Listening. This builds connection, respect, and awareness, not ego.

2. Ask Questions Like a Detective
If a trainer says, “You don’t need to know this,” run. Real teachers explain why. Ask about heart rate, breathing, gaits, and safety. If they can’t answer, they’re not qualified.

3. Read Books ,  Really Read Them
Don’t believe everything you hear at the barn. Pick up a good book. Learn from trusted sources. Knowledge is power. And it protects both you and your horse.

4. Find a Teacher Who Listens
A true rider doesn’t shout commands. They feel, adjust, and guide. Watch their posture, their breath, their eyes. Harmony matters more than speed.

5. Ride with a Plan
Every session should have a purpose: balance, transitions, rhythm, or simply connection. Riding without a goal is just wandering, and it hurts both horse and rider.

6. Don’t Rush the Gaits
Walk, trot, canter, each has its own timing, energy, and flow. Master one before moving to the next. Force creates fear. Patience builds trust.

7. Build Your Time, Not Your Ego
You don’t need hours a day. But you do need consistent effort. Two to three hours a week of grooming, groundwork, and quiet time with your horse? That’s the foundation.

8. Know Your Horse’s Body
Check hooves. Watch breathing. Notice stiffness. Horses communicate through stillness and tension. Learn to read them. They’re not silent, they’re speaking.

9. Join a Community That Cares
Look for riders who talk about ethics, horsemanship, and healing, not status, trophies, or quick fixes. Real riders support each other. They grow together.

10. Protect Your Heart, and Your Horse’s
If something feels off, trust your gut. Walk away from trainers who pressure you, shame you, or sell you on false promises. Your journey matters. So does your horse’s life.



## Final Thought: You’re Not Buying a Horse. You’re Taking a Promise.

Your horse isn’t a toy. It’s not a trophy. It’s a partner. A teacher. A soul who will show you patience, loyalty, and truth, if you’re willing to listen. Don’t let greed steal your dream. Don’t let fear stop you from learning. Take the long way. Ride with purpose. Ride with humility. Because the best riders aren’t the fastest. They’re the ones who care.
And that’s worth far more than any eight lessons ever were.
