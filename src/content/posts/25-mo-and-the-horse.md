Let me tell you about the moment I knew my son Mo wasn’t just riding a horse , It wasn’t when he first climbed on. Not even when he managed a full canter around the paddock , though that was incredible. It was *after*.

He stood there, breathless, covered in sweat, eyes wide with joy… but not from the ride. From *connection*. He looked at the horse, then at me, and said, *“Baba, he’s not just mine. He’s ours.”*

That’s when it hit me: this wasn’t just a hobby. This was transformation.

My son Mo is now 9. He started with horses at 4 ,  not because I pushed him, but because something in him *called* to them. And once he met Dakota, the bond was instant.

> *"Horses are creatures of discipline. Mo understood that at a young age ,  and that was it!"*

### **The Grooming Ritual: Where Respect Begins**

![Mo Lesson](/post_covers/_mo_11.jpg)

Before any ride, before any gallop, before a single step forward ,  Mo starts with the brush.

No rush. No noise. Just quiet, steady strokes. He checks hooves. He listens for sounds. He talks softly, like he’s telling the horse a secret.

I taught him: grooming isn’t just cleaning. It’s communication. It’s trust. It’s saying, *“I see you. I’m here. I care.”*

And every time he finishes? He steps back, looks at the horse, and says, *“Good boy.”* Not because he wants praise ,  but because he means it.

### **Leading the Way: A Leader in Training**

Now, when we go out, Mo leads. Not with force. Not with yelling. With calm, clear direction.

He walks ahead, his hand on the lead rope, eyes scanning the path. He stops when the horse hesitates. He waits when the ground is uneven. He doesn’t push. He *guides*.

And when he rides? He doesn’t just sit. He *feels*. He listens. He adjusts his body like a dancer. His seat is soft. His hands are light. He doesn’t *control* the horse ,  he *moves with* it.

> *"A disciplined ride leads to progress. And I aim to grow alongside my riding partner."*

That’s not just my belief. That’s Mo’s daily practice.

### **Why Kids Love Horses (And Why They Change)**

You know what happens when kids spend real time with horses?

They stop being loud. They stop demanding. They start listening.

Mo’s friends? They used to fight over toys. Now? They take turns grooming. They line up to walk the horse. They ask, *“Can I help?”* instead of *“Can I ride?”*

One boy told me, *“When I’m with the horse, I don’t feel angry anymore.”*

Another said, *“I didn’t know horses could think.”*

They’re learning things no classroom teaches:

- Patience
- Responsibility
- Emotional control
- Empathy

Because horses don’t lie.

> *"Horses do not lie. Humans do."*

If you’re rude, they pull away. If you’re calm, they relax. If you’re inconsistent, they get confused. And if you’re honest? They follow you ,  without hesitation.

### **7 Things Every New Rider Should Know (Before You Even Step Near a Horse)**

1. **Riding is not a sport ,  it’s a relationship.** Your horse isn’t your vehicle. It’s your partner.
2. **Never feed a horse by hand unless you’ve been trained.** They can bite. They can crush fingers. Trust takes time ,  not treats.
3. **Grooming is the foundation.** If you skip it, you skip respect.
4. **Your horse has feelings.** It sees fear, anger, joy ,  and mirrors them back. Be mindful of your energy.
5. **No horse is “just a pet.”** They need structure, routine, and mental stimulation ,  just like humans.
6. **You don’t ride to show off. You ride to grow.** Discipline comes from consistency, not ego.
7. **Always check your gear before riding.** Saddle fit, girth tightness, stirrup length ,  these aren’t small details. They’re life-or-death.

### **Warnings: What NOT to Do (Even If Everyone Else Is Doing It)**

❌ Don’t let your child “ride” a horse without supervision.  
❌ Don’t allow hand-feeding. Ever.  
❌ Don’t use harsh reins or spurs to “teach” a horse.  
❌ Don’t ignore signs of pain ,  ears pinned, tail swishing, head shaking.  
❌ Don’t assume your horse is “fine” because it’s smiling. It might be scared.  
❌ Don’t believe everything you hear at the barn. Ask questions. Read books. Learn.  
❌ Don’t ride just for fun ,  ride with purpose.

### **10 Things Every Teen Rider Should Know**

1. Horses remember every mistake you make ,  and every kind word you say.
2. Riding is not about speed. It’s about balance, timing, and connection.
3. Your voice matters ,  but so does silence.
4. A good rider doesn’t shout ,  they listen.
5. Never ride when you’re angry or stressed. The horse feels it.
6. Your horse is not a toy. It’s a living, breathing, thinking being.
7. Learn how to read body language ,  not just yours, but theirs.
8. Discipline is not punishment. It’s training, guidance, and love.
9. You will fail. That’s okay. What matters is getting back up.
10. The best riders are humble. The loudest ones? Usually the least skilled.

### **7 Things Every Parent Should Know About Horses**

1. **Horses are not pets.** They are animals with complex needs ,  physical, emotional, social.
2. **Time > money.** A $10,000 horse is worthless without daily care and attention.
3. **Your child won’t stay interested forever. But the lessons will.**
4. **Horse ownership changes your family dynamic.** Friendships shift. Routines change. Embrace it.
5. **Horses teach accountability.** If your kid skips grooming, the horse goes hungry.
6. **Horses are not therapy animals ,  but they can heal.** They build resilience, focus, and empathy.
7. **Your child may become a leader.** Not because they want to ,  but because they earned it.

### **Want More? Dive Into the Real Story.**

This isn’t just about Mo. It’s about *you*. It’s about the promise you make when you bring a horse into your life.

> *"I promised him, No amount of money can ever match the value of that promise!"*

That promise saved me. It saved my son. It saved our family.

If you’re ready to move beyond the hype, the ego, the “quick fix” culture ,  and build something real, meaningful, and lasting ,  then you need to read [The Promise: Horses, Healing, and the Human Heart](https://hamzamu.gumroad.com/l/the_promise_book).

This book is more than stories. It’s a roadmap for real horsemanship. For ethical care. For healing. For fatherhood. For truth.
