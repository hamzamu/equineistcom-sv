“Equipment is the key to understand the quality of service.”, Ozgur Pestanli [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ozgurpestanli/)

I’ve stood in stables where the air smelled of sweat, neglect, and silence. I’ve seen horses walk with uneven gaits, their backs hollowed by poorly fitted saddles. I’ve watched riders grip reins like they’re holding onto life itself, because the saddle beneath them was falling apart.

Days ago, I had the rare privilege of sitting down with Mr. Ozgur Pestanli, a man whose life has been shaped not just by riding, but by *living* with horses. His farm isn’t a business. It’s a sanctuary. Over fifty horses live there, alongside donkeys, dogs, even wolves, coexisting in harmony. No forced routines. No artificial control. Just balance. And it shows in every detail.

We were discussing the state of equestrian culture, the growing divide between those who ride for connection and those who ride only to show off. A newcomer joined us, eager to learn, to bring his child into this world. “How do I know if a farm is safe?” he asked. “How do I tell if someone truly cares?”

Ozgur didn’t hesitate.

“Look at the equipment,” he said. “It tells you everything.”

I didn’t just agree, I felt it in my bones.

Because over the past 15 years, visiting more than 100 farms and clubs across Turkey, I’ve learned this truth: **a farm’s equipment doesn’t reflect its budget, it reflects its soul.**

When I walked into Ozgur’s barn, I saw it immediately. His saddles weren’t old, worn, or patched. They were high-quality endurance saddles, some barely broken in. He has a dedicated workshop, clean and organized, where tack is repaired, adjusted, and inspected monthly. There’s a system: checklists, schedules, records. Not because it’s required, but because it’s respect.

And when you see that? You know you’re in a place where the horse comes first.

But here’s what most people miss: **if a farm doesn’t care about its equipment, it doesn’t care about the horse.**

That’s not opinion. That’s observation. That’s experience.

I’ve seen saddles so cracked they looked like they’d survived a war. Bridles frayed at the seams. Stirrups bent from years of use. One farm used the same saddle on six different horses in a single week, no inspection, no adjustment. When I asked why, the caretaker shrugged: “It works.”

It works? For whom?

Not for the horse. Not for the rider. Only for the owner’s wallet.

Because let’s be clear: using damaged, outdated, or ill-fitting gear isn’t just bad practice, it’s abuse.

A poorly fitting saddle causes back pain, muscle atrophy, behavioral resistance, and long-term lameness. A loose girth can cause sudden falls. A worn bridle can snap mid-ride. These aren’t accidents, they’re preventable tragedies.

And yet, we keep seeing them.

Why? Because the farm is built on profit, not partnership.

They don’t invest in quality because they don’t need to. They’ll take your money, rent out a horse, and use the same tack for five riders in a day. They don’t care if the saddle fits. They don’t care if the stirrup is bent. They care only about turnover.

And the worst part? They make it look normal.

They say things like:
- “It’s traditional.”
- “It’s good enough.”
- “You’ll get used to it.”

No. You won’t. Your horse will suffer. Your body will ache. Your confidence will erode.

This isn’t training. This is exploitation.

As I said in my book: *“They utilize horses and abuse people’s love for horses and passion for riding without putting effort, or even investing, in their equipment quality or readiness.”*

That line still burns.

Because it’s true. And it’s happening everywhere.

The real danger isn’t just the poor gear. It’s the message it sends: *Your horse is replaceable. Your safety is optional. Your time is disposable.*

So how do you protect yourself, and your horse?

**Here’s what to look for, right now:**

1. **Saddles:** Are they new? Well-maintained? Do they fit the horse? If they’re cracked, sagging, or clearly worn beyond repair, walk away.
2. **Bridles & Reins:** Frayed? Stiff? Uncomfortable? A good bridle should feel smooth, flexible, and secure, not like it’s held together by hope.
3. **Stirrups:** Bent? Loose? Cracked? Even a small bend changes your balance, and your horse’s comfort.
4. **Workshop & Maintenance System:** Does the farm have a space for repairs? A schedule? Records? If not, it’s not serious.
5. **Staff Knowledge:** Can they explain *why* they use certain gear? Can they adjust a saddle? Or do they just hand it over?

If any of these are missing, the answer is already clear.

You’re not getting a stable. You’re getting a machine.

And the horse? He’s just a tool.

So next time you step into a barn, don’t ask about lessons, fees, or availability.

Ask:  
*“What’s the last time you replaced a saddle?”*  
*“Who checks the bridles before every ride?”*  
*“Is there a maintenance schedule?”*

If they hesitate, smile, and leave.

Because the truth is: **you don’t need a perfect farm. You need a respectful one.**

One where the equipment is cared for. Where the tack is respected. Where the horse is seen, not as a product, but as a partner.

And if that’s not possible? Then find another path.

Because your horse deserves better.

And so do you.
