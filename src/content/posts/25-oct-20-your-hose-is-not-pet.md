It wasn’t in a barn, under a sun-drenched sky. It was in the cold light of a back-alley offer. People tried to steal my horse. When that failed, they offered me money, *a lot* of money, for something I hold sacred. They didn’t understand. How could they? They were trying to sell a promise. A soul. A life’s commitment.



> *"I promised him, No amount of money can ever match the value of that promise!"*



That promise was made to my son. He looked at me with wide eyes and said, *“Baba, don’t sell your horse. I love to see you ride. You smile more when you ride.”* That’s when it hit me: this horse wasn’t just mine. He was ours. A bond built on trust, not transaction.



And yet, all around me, people treat horses like objects. Like toys. Like stock. As if their worth can be measured in dollars, not in moments of quiet connection, in the way a horse nuzzles your hand after a long day, or how his breath syncs with yours during a slow walk through the field.



This isn’t just wrong, it’s dangerous.



**Let me tell you about the moment I learned what a horse truly is.**



When we commodify horses, we erase their spirit. We turn them into machines, not partners. And when we do that, we lose something far greater than a hobby. We lose the healing, the discipline, the truth-telling power that only a real relationship with a horse can bring.



Horses are not pets. They aren’t dogs curled up beside you. They’re wild at heart, social creatures with instincts deeper than we often understand. To treat them like lap animals is to disrespect their nature.



They’re not toys. You don’t “play” with a horse. You don’t throw a saddle on and expect joy. You earn it. Through patience, through effort, through daily care. Horses demand respect. They respond to consistency, not coddling.



And they are certainly not profit machines.



I’ve seen it too many times: trainers who take advantage of busy owners, using their horses without permission, riding them for their own gain. I’ve heard fake experts peddle heavy, outdated tack as “traditional,” charging hundreds for gear that harms both horse and rider. I’ve watched innocent buyers fall for lies, horses sold with hidden injuries, marketed as “perfect” while being pushed past their limits.



> *"The horse isn’t the problem. The people and education are."*



And worse? Some riders buy a horse not for connection, but for ego. To show off. To prove something. But when the novelty fades, and it always does, the horse becomes a burden. Forgotten. Left behind.



That’s not horsemanship. That’s neglect. That’s betrayal.



My horse wasn’t bought. He was chosen. By me. By my son. By a promise. He taught me discipline when I was broken. He gave me focus when I had none. He carried me through dark times, not just physically, but emotionally.



> *"He saved me from a marriage like a prison… from being buried alone in a godforsaken place filled with dishonor and betrayal."*



That’s the real value. Not a price tag. Not a trophy. A transformation.



If you want a horse, ask yourself: *Why?* Is it for joy? For connection? Or for status?



Because if you’re not ready to commit, time, energy, heart, you shouldn’t have one. Horses need routine. They thrive on structure. They don’t survive on weekends and spare time.



> *"Do you really think you can put a value on that?"*



You can’t. Not really.



So why do so many still treat horses like commodities?



Because they haven’t met the real thing. They haven’t felt the weight of a promise. They haven’t sat in silence with a horse and known, without words, that they’re understood.



If you’re ready to build a bond that lasts, a relationship built on truth, responsibility, and mutual respect, then you’re ready for *The Promise: Horses, Healing, and the Human Heart*.



This book is more than stories. It’s a call to change. A manifesto for real horsemanship. A testament to the healing power of a horse who sees you, not as a rider, but as a human.
