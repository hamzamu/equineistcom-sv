**The 9 Horses That Changed My Life (And Why I Recommend Them to Everyone)**

Let me be clear: I don’t just ride horses. I *live* with them. As a doctor, software engineer, and rider who found purpose through the quiet strength of these magnificent creatures, I’ve learned that true horsemanship isn’t about speed or spectacle—it’s about presence, patience, and partnership.

I’ve spent years studying equine behavior, gait analysis, and neuromuscular control—not just for my patients, but for my own healing. And through it all, one truth has remained constant: **horses are not pets. They are teachers.** They reflect us—our intentions, our fears, our growth. When you ride with honesty, they respond with trust. When you’re chaotic, they become confused. A horse doesn’t lie. He tells you the truth, every time.

This philosophy—the idea that riding is a mirror, not a sport—is at the heart of my book, *The Promise*, and now, in this post, I want to share something deeply personal: **the 9 TV series about horses that have inspired me, my students, my friends, and even my family.**

Why? Because while real life with horses demands discipline, routine, and responsibility, stories can open hearts before we ever touch a bridle. These shows aren’t just entertainment—they’re gentle invitations into a world where connection matters more than control, where kindness builds trust faster than commands, and where every ride is a chance to grow.

So if you’re looking for something that sparks curiosity, teaches empathy, or simply makes your child feel like they’ve stepped into a world where they belong—these are the ones I always recommend. Not because they’re perfect, but because they’re *real*. And sometimes, that’s exactly what we need.

### **1. Spirit: Riding Free**  
Set against the wild beauty of the American West, this series follows Lucky, a city girl who bonds with a wild mustang named Spirit. It’s raw, emotional, and deeply respectful of the horse’s spirit. I love how it shows that freedom isn’t about breaking rules—it’s about earning trust. The riding scenes may be dramatic, but the message? Pure. This is the kind of story that makes a child pause and say, *"I want to understand him."*

### **2. Horseland**  
Simple, sweet, and full of heart. Seven kids and their horses go on adventures that teach problem-solving, empathy, and teamwork. While some parents note its lighter tone, I see it as a gateway. It’s safe, fun, and introduces young minds to the rhythm of care—feeding, grooming, leading. It’s the first step toward understanding that a horse isn’t a toy. He’s a partner.

### **3. The Ponysitters Club**  
A powerful story about rescue, redemption, and responsibility. These kids don’t just ride—they heal. They take in abused animals, learn about trauma, and build trust. It mirrors what I do on my farm: rehabilitating Rahvan horses with histories of mistreatment. This show teaches kids that compassion isn’t soft—it’s strong. And that’s exactly what I want my children to know.

### **4. Free Rein**  
Yes, it’s a bit older. Yes, it has teenage drama. But beneath the surface? A deep exploration of healing through horsemanship. Zoe’s journey—from fear to courage—isn’t just about riding. It’s about learning to listen. To breathe. To be present. I’ve shown it to my patients with PTSD and ADHD. One said, *“Finally, someone gets it.”* That’s the power of authentic storytelling.

### **4. The Saddle Club**  
A classic for a reason. Three girls run a riding club, solve mysteries, and support each other through ups and downs. It’s about friendship, loyalty, and the joy of shared purpose. I still remember watching it with my younger sister. It taught me that riding isn’t solitary—it’s community. And that’s why I’ve built my own family-centered healing program around it.

### **5. Heartland**  
For over a decade, this Canadian gem has shown what real horse care looks like. From vet visits to barn chores, from grief to triumph—it’s grounded, emotional, and honest. I’ve used it in workshops to teach new riders about responsibility. “You don’t just ride a horse,” I tell them. “You *live* with him.” This show proves it.

### **6. Wildfire**  
Based on a beloved book series, this one focuses on resilience, trust, and the bond between girl and horse. It’s beautifully shot, emotionally rich, and full of moments that make you pause. I’ve seen kids cry during the final scene—because they felt seen. That’s rare. That’s powerful.

### **7. Ride**  
A modern, clean, and uplifting take on equestrian life. It’s designed for younger audiences, yes—but it’s also for anyone who believes in kindness, consistency, and growth. No drama. No ego. Just good people doing good things with good horses. Perfect for families starting out.

The Best!
### **7. The Black Stallion: Where Freedom Meets Purpose – A Ride That Changes Everything**  

If you’ve read my book, The Promise, you know I believe in the sacred bond between human and horse—not as owner and animal, but as partners. Not for ego, not for show, but for truth, healing, and growth.

That’s why I recommend The New Adventures of the Black Stallion—not just as a story, but as a mirror to what real horsemanship should be.

Alec Ramsay isn’t a rider because he wants fame. He’s not chasing trophies. After being shipwrecked on a desert island with a wild Arabian stallion named the Black, he doesn’t tame him—he earns him. Through silence, patience, and presence, they build something deeper than trust. They build a language. A rhythm. A soul connection.

This is exactly what I’ve lived. The moment Kuzey looked at me after months of quiet work wasn’t one of submission—it was one of recognition. Like he finally saw me. And I saw him.

The Black Stallion teaches us that horses aren’t machines to be controlled. They’re beings who read your heart before your hands. When Alec rides him, it’s not about speed—it’s about harmony. About listening. About riding with the horse, not against him.

And that’s the core of what I teach in The Healing Herd: Horses don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.

This series shows that. Every episode. Every ride. It’s not flashy. It’s not about winning. It’s about becoming. About resilience. About showing up—even when you’re broken.

I’ve seen kids cry during the final scene of the first season—not because of action, but because they felt seen. Because they recognized that same quiet struggle, that same need to be understood.

Yes, it’s inspired by Walter Farley’s novels. But it’s also a living lesson in ethical horsemanship—something we desperately need in today’s world, where too many treat horses like props or status symbols.

I tell every parent, every rider, every child who asks: Watch this. Not just for the adventure—but for the truth.

Because if you want to understand what a horse truly is… you don’t need a saddle. You need a heart. And a willingness to listen.

### **Final Thought: Horses Are Not for Show. They Are for Soul.**

If you’ve read my book, *The Promise*, you know I believe in *ethical horsemanship*—not just riding, but *understanding*. These shows are more than entertainment. They’re tools. They’re mirrors. They’re invitations to a life of purpose, connection, and healing.

So next time you’re looking for something to watch with your child, don’t just pick the loudest or flashiest. Pick one that whispers: *“Listen. Be kind. Grow.”*

Because that’s what horses teach us—and that’s what I’ve spent my life trying to share.

**P.S.** If you’re ready to go deeper, check out my second book, *The Healing Herd*. It’s about design, intention, and relationship—how they heal lives. And yes, it’s full of stories… including one about a horse named Kuzey who changed everything.

*Because sometimes, the most powerful lessons come not from words—but from silence, presence, and a single nicker.*
