## 🐎 Welcome to Your New Best Friend: The Horse Record & Report Generator!

Hey there, horse person! 👋 Whether you’re a proud owner of one amazing steed, a busy farm manager juggling dozens, or part of a riding club keeping track of everyone’s favorite mounts — this tool is here to make your life *so* much easier. And the best part? **It’s 100% private, free, and zero-hassle.**

### 🧭 How It Works (Super Simple!)

Think of it like your personal digital notebook — but way smarter and prettier.

1. **Start with the Basics**  
   Just fill in your horse’s name, age, breed, sex, and owner. Easy peasy. You can even pick from common breeds like Thoroughbred, Arabian, Quarter Horse, and more — no typing required!

2. **Log Every Important Moment**  
   Vaccinations? Farrier visits? Training milestones? Show results? Add them all under “Event History.” Just click “+ Add Event,” enter the date, type (like “Deworming” or “Jumping Clinic”), and add a quick note. You can edit or delete events anytime — no stress!

3. **Repeat for All Your Horses**  
   Got multiple horses? No problem! You can create separate records for each one — Starlight, Thunder, Daisy, you name it. Keep every horse’s story neat and organized in its own timeline.

4. **Combine & Export Everything**  
   Need to send a full report to your vet, trainer, or insurance company? Click **“Download Report”** and boom — you get a clean, professional CSV file that includes *all* your horses’ details and event histories. Open it in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet program. Perfect for sharing, printing, or archiving.

5. **Share or Save (Your Choice!)**  
   Want to email the record to someone? Use the **“Share”** button (if your device supports it). Or just hit **“Save Changes”** to keep everything handy for next time — though remember, we don’t store anything on our end. More on that below 😊
