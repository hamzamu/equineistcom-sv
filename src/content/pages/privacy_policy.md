Hi there ,  welcome to *Equineist*.

I’m a doctor, a coder, and an accidental horse owner who writes about medicine, horsemanship, and the curious intersections between them. This site is personal, thoughtful, and built with care ,  just like the horses I ride and the code I write.

This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, protect, and share your information when you visit *Equineist.com*. No shady tracking. No selling data. Just transparency ,  because trust matters.
