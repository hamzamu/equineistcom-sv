Welcome to *Equineist*, a space where medicine meets movement, code meets compassion, and the bond between humans and horses becomes something far greater than just riding.

I’m not just a writer or a rider. I’m a **doctor**, a **software developer**, and an accidental horse owner who now lives for the rhythm of hooves on dirt, the quiet trust in a horse’s eyes, and the healing power of shared presence.

This site is my life’s work, distilled into stories, insights, and tools that matter. Whether you're a rider pushing your limits, someone exploring equine-assisted therapy, or simply curious about how horses shape our minds, bodies, and spirits, you’re exactly where you should be.

## A Doctor Who Found Healing in the Saddle

As a physician, I’ve spent years diagnosing illness, managing chronic conditions, and advocating for preventive care. But over time, I realized one of the most powerful therapies isn’t found in a pill bottle, it’s found in the arena, on the trail, and in the quiet moments when a horse lowers its head and lets you breathe.

Horses don’t judge. They listen. They respond. And in their stillness, they teach us how to be present, something modern life so often steals from us.

That realization led me to write my first book:

***"The Silent Healers: Horses, Health, and the Mind-Body Connection"***  
,  a deeply researched exploration of equine-assisted therapy, the neurobiology of human-horse bonding, and the overlooked role of horses in mental wellness and trauma recovery.

It’s not just theory. It’s based on clinical observation, personal experience, and conversations with therapists, trainers, and riders across the world.

Since then, I’ve published several articles on:
- The history of equine therapy in ancient cultures
- The psychology of rider confidence and fear
- Misconceptions in training methods (and why some are dangerously common)
- How endurance riding builds resilience ,  in both horse and rider

You can find these pieces on **[Medevel.com](https://medevel.com)** and scattered throughout journals and equestrian forums, always written with rigor, humility, and heart.

## My Horse: Kuzey, Arabian by Blood, Warrior by Spirit

Meet **Kuzey**, my 8-year-old **Arabian stallion**, named after the Turkish word for "north," because he was born under the northern stars, and he carries the north wind in his stride.

He’s not just a horse. He’s a partner. A teacher. A mirror.

We’ve trained together for endurance rides across rugged terrain, from desert trails to mountain passes. Each race isn’t just about speed or stamina; it’s about communication, mutual respect, and listening to what your horse is telling you before words are needed.

Endurance riding has taught me more about patience, mindfulness, and trust than any textbook ever could.

And yes ,  I wear the same gear as him. No exceptions. If he’s carrying weight, so am I. If he’s tired, I’m tired too. That’s the pact we made.

## From Code to Compassion: The Developer Who Loves Horses

By day, I write clean, efficient code, building tools that help doctors manage data, track patient outcomes, and improve healthcare systems. By night? I’m debugging saddle girths, recalibrating bridles, and reading equine anatomy textbooks like they’re novels.

I built this website myself, using open-source tools, secure hosting, and privacy-first design, because I believe technology should serve people, not exploit them.

Just as I use code to build better health systems, I use writing to build better understanding between riders, horses, and communities.

At *Equineist*, I write about:

- **Equine therapy**: How horses help heal trauma, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, backed by science and real stories.
- **Riding ethics**: Challenging harmful traditions, unsafe practices, and outdated myths.
- **Endurance riding**: Training tips, nutrition, injury prevention, and the mental game.

Every post is written with care, because horses deserve nothing less.

### Final Thought

Horses don’t need us to be perfect.  
They only need us to be present.

So let’s ride, not to conquer, but to connect.  
Not to win, but to understand.

With gratitude,  
,  * Equineist*
