Hi there ,  thanks for visiting *The Equineist*.   Whether you're a rider, veterinarian, equine therapist, tech-savvy equestrian, open-source advocate, or someone who’s just curious about how medicine, code, and horsemanship come together ,  you’re in the right place.

I’m a medical doctor, software developer, and accidental horse owner who writes about what I see, learn, and worry about in the riding world. My goal? To share honest, well-reasoned insights ,  the kind that aren’t always spoken aloud, but should be.

### ✉️ Want to contribute?

I welcome thoughtful, well-researched articles from people whose work intersects with:
- Equine health & welfare (especially under-discussed issues)
- Rider safety, biomechanics, or mental wellness
- Technology in equestrianism (e.g., wearables, data tracking, open-source tools)
- Ethical horsemanship, training philosophy, or critical perspectives on common practices
- The intersection of healthcare, digital tools, and animal care

If your writing brings clarity, curiosity, or courage to hard conversations ,  especially ones that challenge the status quo ,  I’d love to publish it here.

### 📬 How to Submit:
1. Email me at: **hamza@medevel.com**
2. Include a brief subject line (e.g., “Guest Submission: [Topic]”)
3. Attach your article (or paste it in the body) with a short bio (1–2 sentences) and any relevant links (your website, LinkedIn, Medevel.com, etc.)

> ✅ We accept original, unpublished work only.  
> ✅ Articles should be 800–2,000 words, clearly written, and grounded in experience or research.  
> ✅ All submissions are reviewed ,  if accepted, you’ll be credited fully and published with a byline.

### 💬 Other Inquiries?
You can also reach out about:
- Speaking opportunities  
- Collaborations (tech + equine, health + horsemanship)  
- Feedback on your own project or blog  
- Just saying hello ,  I love connecting with fellow riders, makers, and thinkers
