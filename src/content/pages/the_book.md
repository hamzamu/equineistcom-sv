You know that feeling when a book doesn’t just tell you a story, but changes the way you see the world? That’s *The Promise*.

It’s not just another horse book. It’s a raw, powerful memoir about healing, fatherhood, and the unbreakable bond between a man and his horse. But before I dive into why this book will move you, let me answer the question that sits at its heart: Why did I write it?

I wrote *The Promise* because I had to. Not for fame, not for money,though I’ve been offered both, repeatedly. No, I wrote it for my son. When I was drowning in a failing marriage, trapped in silence and darkness, my horse wasn’t just a pet. He was my protector, my confidant, my lifeline. He pulled me out of that prison long before I could save myself. And when he did, he gave me a mission: to be better. To be present. To keep promises.

So I made one,to my son. “Baba, don’t sell your horse. I love to see you ride. You smile more when you ride.” That simple sentence became my anchor. I promised him I’d never sell Kuzey. Not for any amount of money. Not even if someone tried to steal him. Because some things can’t be bought. Love. Loyalty. Honor.

But here’s what no one tells you: saving a horse isn’t just about feeding and grooming. It’s about facing your own demons. It’s about learning discipline when you’re tired. It’s about listening,not just with your ears, but with your heart. My horse taught me how to be a better rider, not by force, but by teaching me to listen. And in doing so, he freed me from my old self.

That’s the core of *The Promise*: the idea that we think we’re rescuing horses,but often, they rescue us first.

Now, let’s talk about the book itself.

*The Promise* is structured like a journey through truth, responsibility, and transformation. It’s not a linear memoir, though it has a powerful arc. Instead, it unfolds like a series of revelations,each chapter building on the last, like stones laid across a river.

The book begins with **"The Story of How I Saved My Horse and How He Saved Me!"**,a deeply personal account of my descent into isolation and how a single horse became my salvation. This isn’t just a tale of riding; it’s about emotional survival, the kind of pain most people hide.

Then comes **"Why Giving Away My Horse Offends Those Who Never Truly Rode!"**,a fiery, necessary manifesto. In it, I expose the dangerous myth that horses are commodities. I speak about those who try to pressure owners into selling their horses for profit, or those who call a horse “bad” simply because they’re not ready to do the work. The truth? The horse is rarely the problem. The rider is.

One of the most powerful chapters is **"Your Horse is Your Mirror."** Here, I explore how horses reflect our inner state,our anxiety, our ego, our fear. If your horse resists, ask yourself: What am I doing wrong? This isn’t about blame,it’s about accountability. And that’s rare in a world full of excuses.

Another standout is **"What Is a Horse?"**,a philosophical deep dive into equine intelligence, emotion, and social nature. I challenge readers to stop seeing horses as machines or pets. They’re herd animals, sensitive, intelligent beings. They feel joy, fear, trust. They deserve respect,not ownership.



I also tackle the dark side of riding culture in **"Beware the Fake Gatekeepers of Horse Riding."** These aren’t real experts. They don’t read books. They don’t care about science. They thrive on ignorance, using mystery to control students and profit from their insecurities. I give you tools to spot them: ask them to explain a technique. Ask for sources. Real knowledge isn’t hidden,it’s shared.

And then there’s **"Horses for Kids: Building Character."** As a father, I believe horses are more than companions,they’re teachers. They teach patience, empathy, and resilience. I share stories of my son learning responsibility through caring for Kuzey. Horses don’t lie. They respond to honesty. And kids learn that fast.

The book also includes practical wisdom: **"The Purpose Behind Every Ride," "Choosing a Riding Discipline," "How to Spot a Good Horse Rider,"** and **"Riding with Purpose."** These aren’t just tips,they’re life principles. Every ride should have a goal. Every session should grow you and your horse.

There’s also a quiet moment of hope in **"Perhaps One Day…"** where I imagine my son reading this book years from now, understanding the depth of the promise I made,and the legacy I left behind.

*The Promise* is not perfect. It’s messy. It’s honest. It’s sometimes angry, sometimes tender, always true. It’s written by a doctor, a developer, a seasoned rider,not a celebrity, not a guru. Just a man who found peace in the saddle, and now wants to help others find it too.

This book is for:
- Riders who want to go beyond tricks and routines
- Parents looking for meaningful, character-building activities for their kids
- Anyone healing from trauma, loss, or life transitions
- People who’ve ever felt lost,and need a reason to keep going

If you’ve ever felt like you were riding without purpose, this book will change that. If you’ve ever doubted whether your horse truly understands you, this book will show you how much they do.

More than anything, *The Promise* is a reminder: connection matters. Responsibility matters. Keeping a promise,even to a horse,matters.

So yes, I wrote this book. Not for profit. Not for applause. For my son. For my horse. For every person who’s ever looked into a horse’s eyes and seen something deeper than beauty.

Because sometimes, the ones we think we’re saving end up saving us instead.

If you’re ready to ride with purpose, to heal through honesty, to build something real,then open this book. Turn the page. Let Kuzey lead you home.

*The Promise* isn’t just a book. It’s a vow. And it’s waiting for you.
