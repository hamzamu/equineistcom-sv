## 🌟 **FRONT PAGE TEXT – THE HUMAN TOUCH BEHIND THE HOOF**

### **Hero Section (Main Banner)**

> **Ride With Confidence. Care With Clarity. Live With Love.**  
> *Built by a horse owner, for horse owners.*  

You know that feeling — the wind in your hair, the rhythm of hooves on earth, the quiet bond between rider and horse. But behind every great ride is a thousand decisions: What should I feed my mare? Is this app worth it? Where can I find a safe, kind stable near me?

We’re not here to sell you gear or push affiliate links. We’re here to **help you care better, ride safer, and build stronger connections with your horse** — because we’ve been there too.

### **Why This Exists (Project Overview – ~300 Words)**

Every horse deserves a guardian who knows their needs, their quirks, and their spirit. As a horse owner myself, I’ve spent years learning through trial, error, and late-night Google searches. I’ve seen horses thrive — and struggle — because of small choices: a wrong saddle pad, an outdated farrier, a missed health sign.

That’s why I built **EquiKnow**: a real, honest, no-fluff platform made by horse owners, for horse owners. No corporate jargon. No AI-generated fluff. Just practical wisdom, tested tools, and trusted advice — all in your language.

We’re creating a living library of:
- **Dozens of expert guides** on everything from lameness prevention to pasture management.
- **Honest app reviews** — which ones actually help, and which are just hype?
- **AI-powered care tips** — like predicting colic risk based on feeding patterns, or tracking hoof health over time.
- And yes — a **global directory** where you can find vet clinics, boarding farms, farriers, and riding schools… verified by real riders.

But more than tools, we’re building a **community**. A place where you share stories, ask questions, and find support when your horse isn’t eating well, or your training hits a wall. Whether you're in rural France, suburban Texas, or a remote farm in Chile — **you’re not alone**.

We’re launching in multiple languages so every rider feels seen. Because good care shouldn’t be limited by borders.

This isn’t just a website.  
It’s a promise:  
*To protect horses. To empower owners. To ride better — together.*
