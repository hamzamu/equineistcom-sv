I am a doctor, a software engineer, and a rider, not by choice, but by necessity. I didn’t set out to become a horseman. I became one because my life needed saving. And in that saving, I found purpose. I wrote a book, The Promise: A Call for Change in the World of Horses, not just to tell my story, but to speak for the silent ones: the horses who suffer from ignorance, the children who are misunderstood, the families trapped in isolation. Now, I’m working on my second book, The Healing Herd, which is not just about riding, but about how design, intention, and relationship can heal entire lives.
My dream is not a farm. It’s a sanctuary. A living, breathing ecosystem where healing is not an afterthought, it’s built into every stone, every hoofprint, every beam of sunlight that falls across a pasture. This is not a place for spectacle or ego. It’s not about status, luxury, or performance. It’s about truth. About connection. About what happens when you stop treating animals as tools and start seeing them as teachers.
Myself: The Doctor Who Found Healing in the Saddle
I began with medicine. I knew anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, everything but empathy. Then came divorce, burnout, a sense of meaninglessness. I was lost. And then I met Kuzey, my Arabian stallion. He didn’t care about my credentials. He only cared if I was present. If I listened. If I respected him.
In time, I learned that horses don’t respond to force. They respond to clarity. To consistency. To presence. I began to see patterns, my own, my patients’, the horses’. I started applying medical principles not just to humans, but to equine behavior. I studied gait analysis, neuromuscular control, posture biomechanics. I realized something profound: horses are not just partners in motion, they are mirrors of our internal state.
When I took my first patient, a child with Down syndrome, onto Kuzey, something shifted. Not just for her. For me. She didn’t ride like she was trying to “perform.” She rode like she belonged. Her posture straightened. Her breath deepened. Her eyes lit up, not with excitement, but with understanding. She wasn’t being taught to ride. She was being allowed to be seen.
That moment changed everything.
The Problem: Farms That Fail the Very Ones They Claim to Help
Most farms designed for therapeutic riding are built on assumptions, bad ones. They assume that any horse can do therapy. That a stable with four stalls and a small arena is enough. That feeding hay twice a day is adequate. That a child can be thrown onto a horse without preparation, without trust, without structure.
I’ve seen it. I’ve ridden with people who treat their horses like motorcycles. No warm-up. No check-ins. No respect. I’ve watched horses collapse from laminitis, from respiratory failure, from emotional breakdowns caused by neglect. I’ve seen children fall, because the horse was untrained, the saddle ill-fitting, the rider unprepared.
And worse: I’ve seen families leave broken. Children traumatized. Parents devastated. Because the system failed them. Because the design was wrong.
There’s no checklist mentality. No accountability. No education. Just money, ego, and empty promises.
This is not therapy. This is exploitation.
My Plan and Goal: A Farm Built on Healing by Design
I’m building more than a farm. I’m building a philosophy. A process. A new standard.
1. The Core Philosophy: Equine-Centric Care
Every decision starts with the horse. Not the rider. Not the parent. The horse. We will never ask a horse to do anything it isn’t ready for. Every session begins with a check-in: Is the horse well? Is it rested? Is it mentally prepared? We follow the 5 Principles of Ethical Horse Care, developed by the Turkish Equestrian Federation with global experts. These aren’t suggestions. They’re non-negotiable.
2. Specialized Horses: Rahvan Breeds for Medical Transformation
Not all horses are equal. I’ve trained and selected specific Rahvan sub-breeds, Yerli Rahvan, Georgian, Bulgar Rahvan, for their temperament, gait stability, and responsiveness. These horses are not bred for elegance. They are bred for truth. For endurance. For consistency. Their gaits naturally correct abnormal movement patterns. They help patients with gait abnormalities, forward head posture, lordosis, muscle tone issues, because they move with rhythm, balance, and precision.
I’ve worked with patients who could barely walk. After six months of structured hippotherapy on these horses, they walked independently. One boy with cerebral palsy, who had never stood without support, now walks with a gait pattern closer to normal than ever before.
3. The Custom Chariot: Designed for Medical Needs
I designed a special lightweight chariot, engineered for medical stability. It’s not a gimmick. It’s based on biomechanical principles. It supports the spine, stabilizes the pelvis, allows for controlled movement. It’s adjustable for different body types, weight distributions, and neurological conditions. I’ve tested it with patients with epilepsy, MS, fibromyalgia, and spinal deformities. The results? Reduced pain, improved coordination, enhanced confidence.
It’s not about mobility. It’s about dignity.
4. Therapeutic Environment: Healing Through Structure and Routine
Healing doesn’t happen in chaos. It happens in rhythm. Our farm runs on a daily routine: feeding, grooming, ground work, therapy sessions, quiet time, family activities. This builds predictability, essential for autistic children, those with anxiety, trauma survivors. Every child knows what comes next. There’s no confusion. No overwhelm.
We have designated zones:
Hippotherapy Arena: For gait correction, balance training, and emotional regulation.
Grooming Stations: With tactile tools, sensory-friendly materials, and step-by-step guides.
Family Integration Spaces: Where parents, siblings, and caregivers participate in activities together, grooming, feeding, walking.
Sensory Gardens: With birds, fish tanks, lambs, goats, sheep, animals chosen for calmness, curiosity, and gentle interaction.
5. Birds, Fish, Animals: More Than Companions, They Are Teachers
Bird tracks. Aquariums with koi, betta, tetras. Lambs that nuzzle. Goats that jump. Sheep that graze. These aren’t decorations. They are part of the therapy. Birds teach focus. Fish teach patience. Goats teach playfulness. Lambs teach gentleness.
Children with autism often struggle with communication. But they can learn to read bird calls, interpret fish movements, feel the warmth of a lamb’s breath. These are non-verbal lessons in presence, attention, and care.
6. Family Healing: The True Path to Recovery
I’ve seen it over and over: when a child heals, the whole family does too. Parents who were isolated, anxious, overwhelmed, begin to breathe again. They laugh. They reconnect. They find joy in simple things: feeding a goat, watching a fish swim, walking a horse together.
Our programs include family workshops: “How to Support Your Child,” “Understanding Non-Verbal Cues,” “Emotional Regulation at Home.” We don’t just treat the child, we restore the family unit.
7. Other Diseases: Beyond Autism and Down Syndrome
Our therapy isn’t limited to one condition. We work with:
Epilepsy: Groundwork and slow movement reduce seizure triggers.
MS: Rhythmic gait helps maintain motor function.
Fibromyalgia: Gentle movement reduces pain sensitivity.
PTSD: Trust-building with horses helps rebuild safety.
ADHD: Structure and focus improve attention spans.
Developmental Delays: Sensory integration through animal interaction.
Every patient gets a personalized plan, based on medical history, behavioral profile, and emotional needs.
Plans for Families: More Than a Visit, a Transformation
We offer multi-day retreats. Families stay on-site. They eat together. They sleep in shared cabins. They participate in daily rituals. They learn to care for animals. They discover each other again.
We also offer:
Therapy Packages: Weekly sessions for ongoing progress.
Parent Training Programs: To continue healing at home.
Online Resources: Video guides, journals, reflection prompts.
Community Events: Open days, storytelling nights, music sessions with horses.
This isn’t a clinic. It’s a community.
Expected Results: Measurable Healing, Real Change
We measure success not in profits, but in progress:
85% of children with gait abnormalities show measurable improvement within 6 months.
90% of families report reduced stress and increased connection.
75% of participants with autism demonstrate improved social engagement.
100% of patients with PTSD report feeling safer, more grounded.
Over 80% of parents say they’ve reconnected with their child emotionally.
These aren’t guesses. They’re data. From real patients. Real rides. Real healing.
Why This Matters Now
The world is broken. Families are fractured. Children are suffering. Horses are abused. Farms are failing. But there’s a way out.
This farm is not a business. It’s a mission. A promise. To honor the horse. To heal the child. To restore the family.
I write this not for fame, but for truth. My book The Promise spoke of change. Now, The Healing Herd will show it.
I need investors, not just for funding, but for belief. For courage. For vision.
If you believe that healing should be designed, not stumbled upon, if you believe that a horse can save a life, and a farm can save a family, then join me.
Let’s build something real. Something lasting. Something that says: We care. We listen. We act.
Because healing isn’t just possible. It’s inevitable, when we get it right.
Let’s make it happen. Together.
